# Matrix-operations
## We will introduce simple matrix operations.
### An array can be represented in the form nrLine nrColumns nrLine * nrColumns_elements
## The operations we can use on the matrix are:
• add - we add all the elements in the matrix with the value of the operand;  
• sub - subtract from all elements in the matrix the value of the operand;  
• mul - we multiply all the elements in the matrix by the value of the operand;  
• div - we divide all the elements in the matrix by the value of the operand;  
• rot90d - rotate the matrix 90 degrees to the right;  
# Example
1. x 2 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 let x -2 add
2. x 2 3 -1 0 1 2 3 4 let rot90d
## Output
1. 2 3 -1 0 1 2 3 4
2. 3 2 2 -1 3 0 4 1
